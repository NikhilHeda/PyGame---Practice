Moving Objects

1. Poblems
	a) Pressing and holding the key, does not work.
	b) even if it is in the game loop, we dont have a repeated movement. So if we press left/right key, that movement is not continuing
	
2. fixing b)
	use a third variable and use that to change the movement variables (lead_x, lead_y) in the game loop and not the event loop (because event is not a repeated movement, its a state.)

3. Problem:
	a) loops are very FAST !
	b) we define frames per second. To slow it down so the user can see the movement
