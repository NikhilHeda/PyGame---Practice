Frames per second

1. define a "clocked variable", and use it in the pygame's clock

2. initialize before the game loop.

	clock = pygame.time.Clock()		# returns a pygame Clock object, outside game loop
	FPS = 30						# 30 is most popular for games.
	clock.tick(FPS)
	
3. Dont change the fps, try to change the movement variables, to change the speed of the game.
