Colors and Fill

1. Putting stuff on screen:
	a) Sprites: image put on surface.
	b) Built in drawing tools
	
2. Structure for defining colors:
	after pygame.init(), usually the tuples (R, G, B, Alpha) for colors is defined.
	
	white = (255, 255, 255)
	black = (0, 0, 0)
	red = (255, 0, 0)
	
3. fill to draw:
	inside the "game loop", we give our colors to the screen.
	fill works on a surface object.
	
	gameDisplay.fill(white)
	pygame.display.update()
	
4. we draw everything on the background and then we render it, because rendering takes the most of the processing power. So, after doiing all the actions, we update it.

5. with fill you can do graphics acceleration.
